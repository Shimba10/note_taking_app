# note_taking_app
setup->
run these commands
1-> pip install -r requirements.txt
2-> python manage.py makemigrations
3-> python manage.py migrate
4-> python manage.py runserver

After this, the project will run and we can check in postman by hitting APIs.

If you don't want to setup then I have also hosted the web application in aws. I have given the postman collections for both local and hosted web application (aws) in the mail.
